This repo contains scripts used in the paper [Machine Learning-Based Predictive Modeling of Postpartum Depression](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/9/2899). We trained machine learning models to predict postpartum depression, and further analysed our models to find features that are important in the development of this phenotype.
